So, in the initial iteration of KAPPACOLLECTOR, I had zero outline and zero plan. That ended up being the 0.1 release, which I am not proud of. When I returned to fix it 3 months later, I realized that it was so fucked that It would genuinely be more efficient to just wholly remake the thing, which is what you’re currently reading on.
But I digress.
In KAPPACOLLECTOR, I had to kinda throw together code that manually handled choice quests. This was, of course, a terrible fucking idea, the system really never worked right, and that was a big part of why I decided to hit the reset button. The way that the code is handled now is much better.\\n\\nI could seriously write a whole document on the shit I did wrong with the inital release. But hey, that’s life. Onwards and upwards."
